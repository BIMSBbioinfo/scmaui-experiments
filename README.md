This repository provides tutorials about how to use [scMaui](https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/scmaui) for various types of single-cell multiomics data. 
scMaui (Single-cell Multiomics Autoencoder Integration) is a new single-cell multiomics integration method based on variational product-of-experts autoencoders and adversarial learning.
